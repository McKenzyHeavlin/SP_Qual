Flashcards for UIUC Security &amp; Privacy Qualifying Exam

# Card Structure
All cards are simple front/back set up; mostly to test recalling paper implementation details, attacker models, etc;. Algorithms aren't included frequently but could be added on your own set.
- Start the question by putting an abbreviation of the paper name in [] (e.g. [Car] for the automotive attack surfaces paper or [Deanony] for the denonymization of sparse datasets papers).
- Try to include section references to where you pulled the question/answer from. My first ones didn't have them, but it would be helpful as we crowdsource more cards.
- Check the list below to see what papers/sections need work yet.

# Developing New Cards
1. Check the 'Yet To Add' list below; select a paper to write cards for; and update the README and move the paper title to 'In Progress'.
2. Write questions/answers in a manner that can be easily saved/exported as a .csv file. I would suggest NOT doing this directly in Anki, as exporting is annoying.
3. Update the Github repo with your changes to the 
4. Update the README to reflect changes appropriately.
5. Notify the study group that new cards are complete.

# Using the Cards
1. Import .csv file into Anki.
2. Create/merge with your desired deck.
3. Anki should track updates to individual cards, so feel free to refine/add additional items.
