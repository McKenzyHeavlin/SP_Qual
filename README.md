Flashcards for UIUC Security &amp; Privacy Qualifying Exam

# Card Structure
All cards are simple front/back set up; mostly to test recalling paper implementation details, attacker models, etc;. Algorithms aren't included frequently but could be added on your own set.
Start the question by putting an abbreviation of the paper name in [] (e.g. [Car] for the automotive attack surfaces paper or [Deanony] for the denonymization of sparse datasets papers).
Try to include section references to where you pulled the question/answer from. My first ones didn't have them, but it would be helpful as we crowdsource more cards.
Check the list below to not double up on questions.
